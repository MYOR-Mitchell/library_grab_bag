# My Grab Bag!  lol

These methods are random first thoughts that came from my typing exercise. 
Some have been used on my previous projects, so they came to mind first, but most are just whatever I come up with! lol
 
Final thought before switching off:

Any that don't follow SRP I'll bridged using DI.
